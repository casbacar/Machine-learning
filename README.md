# Machine-learning

This project evaluates machine learning approaches for predicting weather patterns and climate change impacts across Europe. Working with the European nonprofit organization ClimateWins, we analyzed temperature data from various European weather stations to determine the most effective prediction methods while considering ethical implications and resource constraints.

## Key Findings
Gradient descent optimization tests revealed that simple, differentiable functions work well with our climate data
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm achieved 60% accuracy with 3 neighbors
Decision trees proved overly complex and less accurate for this application
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) performed similarly to KNN but with less interpretability
